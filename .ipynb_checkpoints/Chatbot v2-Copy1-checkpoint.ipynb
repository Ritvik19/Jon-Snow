       " 'Eventually, they changed the name to Google; the name of the search engine originated from a misspelling of the word \"googol\", the number 1 followed by 100 zeros, which was picked to signify that the search engine was intended to provide large quantities of information.',\n",

       " 'Craig Silverstein, a fellow PhD student at Stanford, was hired as the first employee.Google was initially funded by an August 1998 contribution of $100,000 from Andy Bechtolsheim, co-founder of Sun Microsystems; the money was given before Google was incorporated.',\n",
       " 'Google received money from three other angel investors in 1998: Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, Stanford University computer science professor David Cheriton, and entrepreneur Ram Shriram.',\n",
       " 'Between these initial investors, friends, and family Google raised around 1 million dollars, which is what allowed them to open up their original shop in Menlo Park, California After some additional, small investments through the end of 1998 to early 1999, a new $25 million round of funding was announced on June 7, 1999, with major investors including the venture capital firms Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital.',\n",
       " '=== Growth ===\\nIn March 1999, the company moved its offices to Palo Alto, California, which is home to several prominent Silicon Valley technology start-ups.',\n",
       " \"The next year, Google began selling advertisements associated with search keywords against Page and Brin's initial opposition toward an advertising-funded search engine.\",\n",
